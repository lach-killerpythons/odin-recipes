    <p>I have to admit, I was never the biggest fan of blue cheese until I dipped a chicken wing in some blue cheese sauce!</p>
    <p>I was at my local supermarket, and something jumped out at me in the cheese section - half price blue cheese </p>
    <p>I quickly remembered I had a leek, home-made chicken stock and a big old cauliflower and milk at home that needed to be used up</p>
    <p>In that moment I had an incredible idea for dinner! </p>
    <p>I was certainly not the first person to think of this - but if you looking for a rich French style soup on a cold night <i>would highly recommend!</i></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large leek (or 1 white onion) - cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>[OPTIONAL] Small chunk of 'Speck' (or bacon) cut into lardons/small cubes </li>
        <li>Butter </li>
        <li>1 half cauliflower </li>
        <li>Chicken Stock </li>
        <li>Milk </li>
        <li>Cooking Cream </li>
        <li>Small portion of blue cheese </li>
        <li>Olive oil (for cooking + finishing) </li>
        <li>Parsley (for finishing) </li>
        <li>Rustic bread to serve with </li>
    </ul>>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut up cauliflower into large pieces and put into a large baking dish at a high heat with olive oil + salt</li>
        <li>In a large pot - render down speck/lardons (or bacon) until crispy + fat renders</li>
        <li>Add the leek to the pot with some butter and sweat down on a reduced heat</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock when this starts to dry out - scrape the fond from the bottom</li>
        <li>After 20-25mins the cauliflower should be starting to char, depending on your oven - this is key part of developing the flavour</li>
        <li>Add the roasted cauliflower + milk + blue cheese to the pot - slightly submerging the cauliflower + cheese </li>
        <li>Give the cheese time to melt in the boiling liquid and the cauliflower to fall apart </li>
        <li>When the cheese + milk form a homogenous mixture use an immersion blender to blitz the cauliflower/leek/pork </li>
        <li>Based on how creamy your current mixture is, add a dolop of cream using your intuition </li>
        <li>Once everything is well combined - serve in a bowl topped with diced parsley, olive oil and toasted bread </li>
    </ol>
